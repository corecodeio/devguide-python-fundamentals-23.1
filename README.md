## 1. How to use this guide

Feel free to browse the different sections of this guide, here you can find your schedule, the topics of the week and help material that will serve you during the week. We recommend you start by observing the schedule and beginning to organize yourself. After that it is recommended that you look at the "Technologies" section, this is the most important part of this guide, in that section you will find a list of the technologies that will be seen for each week, within each week you will find the challenges that you will be solving in the ‚ÄúCode Practice‚Äù block (see the schedule section), as well as the necessary links for the week

## 2. Introduction
