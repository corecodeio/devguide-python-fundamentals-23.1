# Print my name

## Description

This will be a guided challenge, the idea is for you to use PSeInt. For this challenge, we will print your name on the screen, a simple task that will help us to review the way PSeInt works.

First, you will need to open PSeInt, after that you will have something like this:

The very first thing that we are going to do is to give this algorithm a name, so select the `sin_titulo` section and add your name, on the above picture you will find that I have added the name: `myName`

Next, you will start creating the instructions for the computer to show your name, for this you need to add the `Imprimir` instruction, this instruction tells the computer that you want the computer to show something on the screen when you run the algorithm, for instance, we will only write the instruction. Hit enter and start writing the instruction on the second line of code.
It should look like this:

Now‚Ä¶ maybe you are wondering, how the computer will know that it should show my name on the screen? , well, we haven't told the computer that, so for now your algorithm won't work. If we try to run the algorithm an error message will be shown, specifically this error: `ERROR 53: Faltan par√°metros.` (see picture above), which means that the computer is missing data from the instruction because the instruction is ambiguous. Why is that, well, if you take a look, the instruction `Imprimir` is telling the computer to print (Imprimir) but it is not telling the computer what to print. The computer can‚Äôt take decisions and the instructions that we write for our algorithms need to be clear and unambiguous.

For us to fix the issue we need to tell the computer what to print, so after the instruction Imprimir, we should add the thing that we want to show on the screen, we will do this by telling the computer to print `string` (a list of characters) these characters are going to be the ones from our name, remember that for us to write a string, we need to use the [single quote](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/singquot.htm) character at the start and at the end of the list of characters. My name is Yosef Maldonado, so I will add that (see the image above)

It is time for us to test the result. Hit the run (Ejecutar) button.

If everything is ok, you will have this result

Congratulations!! ü•≥üéàüçæüéá

## Extra

With PSeInt you can save your work just as you save a Word file or a Text file, to save your work in a file, you need to select `Archivo` from the navigation menu of PSeInt, and then select `Guardar como`

The file explorer of your computer will open and you can choose a name for the file you are going to save, this file will have your algorithm so you can open it on any time with PSeInt
