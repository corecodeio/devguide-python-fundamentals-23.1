# Truth tables

## Description

You are going to learn about three main logical operations used in programming, these operations are called AND, OR, and NOT. Each of the operations uses booleans as operands, and when applying the operations a result is generated, which is also a boolean, this is easier to check using the Truth Tables for each of the operations, now your task is for you to learn, and add the Truth Tables for each of the operations add them to your README and check if the following operations are correct by answering ✅ or ❌ at the end of each operation

Operations:

> Remember that AND can be represented by &

> Remember that OR can be represented by |

> Remember that NOT can be represented by ~

1. T `&` T = T
2. T `&` F = F
3. F `&` T = T
4. F `&` F = F
5. T `|` T = T
6. T `|` F = F
7. F `|` T = T
8. F `|` F = F
9. `~`T = T
10. `~`F = T
11. (T `&` F) `|` (`~`F) = T
12. (T `|` F ) `&` (F `|` F) = T
13. `~`((T `|` F ) `&` (F `|` F)) `&` F = T
14. `~`((T `|` F ) `&` (F `|` F)) `&` T = F
