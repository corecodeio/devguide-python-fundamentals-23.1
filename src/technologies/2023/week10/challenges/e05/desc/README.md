# Create a Try/Except where code is executed if no exception is raised and regardless of whether an exception is raised or not and specifically if an exception is raised 


## Description

A `try/except` block is used to handle exceptions in Python code. In this exercise demostrate how to create a `try/except` block that includes a `finally` block and an `else` block. Do this all inside of a function where you search an element in a list by index.

## Expected output
```python
# test the function with a valid index
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(get_element_at_index(my_list, 2)) # output: 3
# prints "No exception raised" and "Finally block executed"

# test the function with an invalid index
print(get_element_at_index(my_list, 10)) # output: None
# prints "IndexError: index 10 is out of range" and "Finally block executed"
```
