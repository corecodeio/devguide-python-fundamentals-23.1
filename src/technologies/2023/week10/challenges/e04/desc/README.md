# Creating a requirements.txt File and Installing Dependencies in a Virtual Environment

## Description

A `requirements.txt` file is a text file that lists the dependencies of a Python project. This exercise should create a `requirements.txt` file using the `pip freeze` command, create a local virtual environment using the `virtualenv` package, and install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

## Expected output

```bash
# requirements.txt created
# virtual environment created and activated
# dependencies installed
```
