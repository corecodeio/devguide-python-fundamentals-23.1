Marking non-feature films\n","<p>Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as \"Children\", \"Stand-Up\", and \"Documentaries\". This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. </p>\n","<p>We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again.
