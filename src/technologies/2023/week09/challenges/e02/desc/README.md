# Nested Functions


## Description

Write a program that defines a function called `outer` that creates a variable called `x` and a nested function called `inner`. The inner function prints the value of `x`. Call the `outer` function and then call the inner function to print the value of `x`. Change the value of `x` in the `outer` function and then call the `inner` function again to see if the value of `x` has changed.

## Expected output
```python
outer() 
```
