# Nested Functions



## Solution üèÅ
    
```python
def outer():
    x = 5
    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        print(x)
    inner()
    x = 10
    inner()
    
outer() 
```

In this program, we defined a function called `outer` that creates a variable called `x` and a nested function called `inner` that prints the value of `x`. We then called `inner` to print the value of `x`, which was set to 5.

We then updated the value of `x` to 10 and called `inner` again to confirm that the value of `x` was updated. We used the nonlocal keyword to indicate that we were updating the value of `x` in the `outer` function, not creating a new variable called `x` in the `inner` function.
