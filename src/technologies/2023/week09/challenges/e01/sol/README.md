# Use a global variable



## Solution 🏁
    
```python
x = 5

def change_x():
    global x
    x = 10
    
change_x()
print(x)
```

In this program, we defined a global variable called `x` and a function called `change_x` that changes the value of `x` to 10 using the `global` keyword. We then called `change_x` to update the value of `x`, and printed the value of `x` to confirm that it was updated.
