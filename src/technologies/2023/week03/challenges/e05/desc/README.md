# Simple calculator with Do While

## Description

For this challenge we are going to use the simple calculator that we made in the [challenge 02](../../e02/desc/) but now adding the functionality to perform a calculation again without finishing the program. The program should ask us if we want to use another operation and if the user answers yes then we can perform a new operation. To solve this challenge remember to use **Do while (Repetir Hasta Que)**.
