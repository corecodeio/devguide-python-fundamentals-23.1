# Install Python

## Description

We need to setup our local environment to get started with Python development.

## Installation üêç

Python is available on most operating system, (Linux, Unix, Mac OS X and Windows).

### Check for previous installation

Open your terminal (CMD for Windows) and type in the following command: `python --version`. Also, you can run `python3 -V`.

If the output does not display a version, you need to follow the next instructions, based on your operative system.

#### Windows
Unlike most Linux distributions, Windows doesn‚Äôt come shipped with Python. You have two options here:

1. Install Python From The Microsoft Store Package: the easiest way to install it is opening the Microsoft Store app and searching for Python 3.9 (or higher), we should make sure that we have the latest Windows updates.

2. Install Python From The Python Installer

   1. Go to the official page and [download for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
   2. Select and download the installer (32-64 bits).
   3. Run installer and follow the recommended install options.
   4. To verify that Python was installed successfully, check as we did under the above heading **"Check That Python Was Installed"**.

#### macOS

1. Using Homebrew (Package Manager): make sure you have Homebrew installed and run the following command in your terminal:

	`brew install python3`

2. From The Python Installer

	1. Go to the official page and [download for macOS](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/).
	2. Select and download the installer
	3. Open the installer package and follow the recommended install options. 

#### Linux

Updated distros comes with the built-in Python package installed. However, you can install it with the next command on your terminal:

`sudo apt install python3.9`

### Final step

You can open your terminal and type `python` without any other param, just to open a **Python shell** to execute Python code, as the following example:
