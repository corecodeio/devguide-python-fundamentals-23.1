# Is Number

## Description

Write a program that uses Python 3â€™s built-in function `input()` to accept user input. Then, use the `print()` function to display the message: `Is Number: {Boolean}` with the value of `True` if the input was a number.

**Hint:** strings in Python have a special built-in function, you don't need to develop a function or something else.
