# Treasure

## Solution ðŸ˜Ž

We are in a room with three chests. We know that at least one has a treasure in it. Each chest has a message, but all the messages are lies.

Since each chest has a message and all the messages are lies, we need to remove the illogical options or contradictions.

Left chest: The middle chest has a treasure --> then, since it is a lie, the middle chest cannot possible have a treasure <br>
Middle chest: All these chests have treasures in them --> then since it is a lie, not all of the chest will have treasure, but some might <br>
Right chest: Only one of these chests has treasures. --> since it is a lie, it is not possible for only one of the chest to have treasure <br>

Given this information, the only two possible options are: none of the chest have treasure or left and right have treasures.

Since we know that at least one has treasure, as we read in the instructions, the only possible is 'left and right have treasures'.

So the answer is chest A and chest C.
