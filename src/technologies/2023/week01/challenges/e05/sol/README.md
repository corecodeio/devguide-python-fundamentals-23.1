# DOB

## Solution ðŸ˜Ž

1. Ask for the date of birth and call it 'date_of_birth'
2. Calculate in which year and date we are currently now (2022) and call it 'right_now'
3. The year and date in which we are right now is mathematically bigger than any date of birth (e.g. 2022 and 1995)
4. So, we need to substract 'date_of_birth' from 'right_now' in order to get the age <br>
   4.1 Calculate as: 'age' = 'right_now' - 'date_of_birth'
5. Print the result calculated in age
6. End
