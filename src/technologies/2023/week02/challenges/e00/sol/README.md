## Solution ðŸ˜Ž

The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday". <br>
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday". <br>
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday". <br>
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday". <br>
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".<br>

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?<br>

We try to verify which case can be possible and without any contradiction. For example, if we assume that Alice is telling the truth, that means nobody study, but if she is telling she studied, that is illogical and not possible. <br>

If Charlie is telling the truth, two people studied. But he is telling the truth, no one else can tell the truth since there are different sentences, as '1 person studied' and '2 people studied' cannot be both true at the same time. <br>

The only possible solution reminding is Bob, as he can be telling the truth, while be the only one who had studied. <br>

So the answer is: Bob is telling the truth
