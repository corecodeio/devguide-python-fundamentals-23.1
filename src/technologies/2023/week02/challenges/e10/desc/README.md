# Identify odd and even numbers

# Description

Remember the last challenge about the Mod operator? well, today your task will be to create a program that will be able to detect based on the user input if the number is odd or even. The process should be the following:

1. The user enters a number
2. Your algorithm detects if the number is odd or even (remember to use conditional statements `Si...Entonces`)
3. Print â€˜NÃºmero: x es parâ€™ if the number is even (x is the number the user enters)
4. Print â€˜NÃºmero: x es imparâ€™ if the number is odd (x is the number the user enters)

## Expected output

![detectOddEven](../../../assets/detectOddEven.gif 'detectOddEven')
