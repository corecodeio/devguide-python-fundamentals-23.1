# Creating a Bank Account Class


## Description

Create a class called BankAccount that has the following attributes:

```python
owner #(a string representing the owner's name)
balance #(a float representing the balance)
```

The class should also have the following methods:

```python
deposit(amount) #(adds amount to the balance)
withdraw(amount) #(subtracts amount from the balance, but only if the balance is sufficient)
get_balance() #(returns the current balance)
```

Next, create an instance of the class for a bank account with an owner named "John Doe" and an initial balance of $100. Test the deposit, withdraw, and get_balance methods to make sure they work as expected.


## Expected output
```python
# create an instance of the class
john_account = BankAccount("John Doe", 100.0)

# test the methods
print(john_account.get_balance())  # output: 100.0

john_account.deposit(50.0)
print(john_account.get_balance())  # output: 150.0

john_account.withdraw(25.0)
print(john_account.get_balance())  # output: 125.0

john_account.withdraw(200.0)  # output: Insufficient funds
print(john_account.get_balance())  # output: 125.0
```
