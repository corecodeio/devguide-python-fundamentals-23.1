# Inheriting from a Parent Class


## Description

Create a class called Animal that has the following attributes:

```python
name #(a string representing the animal's name)
species #(a string representing the animal's species)
```

The class should also have a method called `make_sound()` that prints the sound that the animal makes.

Next, create a subclass called `Dog` that inherits from the `Animal class`. The `Dog` class should have an additional attribute called `breed` (a string representing the dog's breed) and an additional method called `bark()` that prints the sound that a dog makes ("woof").

Create an instance of the `Dog` class and test the `make_sound()` and `bark()` methods to make sure they work as expected.


## Expected output
```python
# create an instance of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Fido", "Canis lupus familiaris", "Labrador Retriever")

# test the methods
my_dog.make_sound()  # output: woof
```
