<h1 align="center">Pseudocode & End of Month - Week 4</h1>

## Week goal 🏁

<p>We'll be practicing about Pseudocode through exercises that includes conditionals, loops and statements (i.e. control structures). For this week we will be using (again) PSeInt and getting started learning some initial concepts of <strong>Python language</strong>. You may wonder why the name of the algorithms or processes in PSeInt uses <i>snake case</i> naming style. It's simple: we're getting ready for our Python section. </p>
