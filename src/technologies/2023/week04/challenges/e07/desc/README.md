# Python Intro

## Description 🐍

Python is a programming language used to develop applications of any kind. It is an interpretive language, which means that it is not necessary to transform it to process applications written in Python. Python is an interpreted language, which means that code is **executed line-by-line** rather than being compiled into machine code. 

One of the key features of Python is its large standard library, which includes modules for many common programming tasks such as working with databases, networking, and file I/O. Python also has a large ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks that extend its capabilities even further.

### How Python is translated into machine code
Python is an interpreted language, which means that the source code is executed directly by the Python interpreter without being translated into machine code beforehand. However, the interpreter itself is written in a lower-level language such as C or C++, and this lower-level code is compiled into machine code.

When a Python program is executed, the interpreter reads each line of the code and translates it into bytecode, which is a low-level representation of the code that can be executed by the interpreter. This bytecode is then executed by the interpreter, which runs the program.

### History

Python was first conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum while working at the Dutch research institute CWI. He was inspired by several other programming languages, including ABC, Modula-3, and Lisp. 

The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python. The comedy series was creative and well random. It talks about everything. Thus it is slow and unpredictable, which made it very interesting.

Today, Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and is used for a wide range of applications including web development, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.


### Versions

The first version of Python, version 0.9.0, was released in February 1991. It was a simple language, with only a few basic data types and control structures. In 2000, **Python 2.0** was released, which included many new features such as list comprehensions and a garbage collector.

In 2008, development of **Python 3.0** began. This version of Python included many improvements and new features, but it also introduced some changes that were not backward-compatible with previous versions of Python. This led to some controversy within the Python community, as developers had to decide whether to continue using Python 2 or switch to Python 3.

> Python 3.10.4 is the latest stable version. 

However, our suggestion is to use at least a version of **Python >= 3.8**. Multiple libraries that you may use in the future will work and will have compatibility with this version. You can see more about versions status [here](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).

## Final thoughts

In this section we discuss about concepts, history and very basic info you may take in mind before diving into the world of Python programming. In the next [section](../../e08/desc/) we will do a hands-on to develop our first `Hello World` 🚀.
