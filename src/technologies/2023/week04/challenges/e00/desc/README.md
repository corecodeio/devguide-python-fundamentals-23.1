# Ascending sort checker

## Description

Make a program that asks for a series of positive numbers (greater than or equal to zero) entered by keyboard, and determines if the series is in ascending order. The end of the series is given by a negative number (e.g. 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 13, 13, 17, -1 is a ascending series). **Remember:** the last number can be any negative number.

**Hint:** You should use a loop section to get the user input and check every input value. Don't forget we can enter duplicate values.
