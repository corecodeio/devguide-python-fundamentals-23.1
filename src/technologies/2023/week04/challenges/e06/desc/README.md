# Factorial (recursive)

## Description

Make a program with a **recursive function** that allows you to calculate the factorial of a number. Make a main process where an integer is read and the result of the factorial is displayed (return value from function and print final value after result retrieved).

The signature of `calculate_factorial` function is:
- Name: factorial
- Args: limit (`Entero`)
- Return value: fact (`Entero`)
