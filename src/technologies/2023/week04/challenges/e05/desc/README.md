# Vowel counter

## Description

Make a program that allows you to enter a text by keyboard, then loop through the text (every character) and count the number of vowels present. When finished, print the number of vowels found.

Your `vowel_counter` function have to return the vowel quantity as value. The same function must be called with the `text` value from your main program, following the next signature: 
- Name: vowel_counter
- Args: text (`Caracter`)
- Return value: res (`Entero`)

**Hint**: You can use a `For Loop (Para Hasta)` to loop between the length of the text passed in your function. Also, a conditional is necessary to count (or not) if the char at such position is a vowel.
