# Incremental count

## Description

Make a program that makes a dynamic incremental count, that receives the following values from user input:
- Initial value
- Final value
- Step

Your `incremental_count` function have to print only the values between the desired range. The same function must be called with the `init`, `final` and `step` values from your main program, following the next signature: 
- Name: incremental_count
- Args: initial, final, step (`Real or Entero`)
- Return value: None

You can use a Do While (`Repetir Hasta Que` block) or a For Next (`Para Hasta`) loop (see docs).
