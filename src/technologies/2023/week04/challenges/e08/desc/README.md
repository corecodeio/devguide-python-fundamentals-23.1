# Run Python

## Installation üêç

Python is available on most operating system, (Linux, Unix, Mac OS X and Windows).

### Check for previous installation

Open your terminal (CMD for Windows) and type in the following command: `python --version`. Also, you can run `python3 -V`.

![version](../../../assets/python_version.png 'Version check')

If the output does not display a version, you need to follow the next instructions, based on your operative system.

### Windows
Unlike most Linux distributions, Windows doesn‚Äôt come shipped with Python. You have two options here:

1. Install Python From The Microsoft Store Package: the easiest way to install it is opening the Microsoft Store app and searching for Python 3.9 (or higher), we should make sure that we have the latest Windows updates.

2. Install Python From The Python Installer

   1. Go to the official page and [download for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
   2. Select and download the installer (32-64 bits).
   3. Run installer and follow the recommended install options.
   4. To verify that Python was installed successfully, check as we did under the above heading **"Check That Python Was Installed"**.

### macOS

1. Using Homebrew (Package Manager): make sure you have Homebrew installed and run the following command in your terminal:

	`brew install python3`

2. From The Python Installer

	1. Go to the official page and [download for macOS](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/).
  1. Select and download the installer
  2. Open the installer package and follow the recommended install options. 

### Linux

Updated distros comes with the built-in Python package installed. However, you can install it with the next command on your terminal:

`sudo apt install python3.9`

## Our first Hello World

Let's make our first program in Python!

We'll explain more about the Python syntax on the next sections. In this initial program, we're gonna create a new file with the `.py` extension. The next instruction will output a text on terminal:

```python
print('Hello World)
```

To execute the program, type `python` and the file name in the shell

![hello world run](../../../assets/python_hello_world_run.gif 'Hello World Run')


## Python online

Developers preferably use Python installed in a local environment. However, there are other environments where code can be executed online. Some of them are:

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [Replit](https://replit.com/languages/python3)
- [Online Python](https://www.online-python.com/)

The next step is to keep going with the Python module, and here are some recommendations if you wanna learn and practice more about Python:

1. Start with the basics: get a good grasp of the basic concepts of Python. 

2. Use online resources: There are plenty of online resources available to learn Python, including video tutorials, blogs, etc.

3. Practice coding: The best way to learn Python is to write code.

4. Build projects: this will help you to apply your knowledge and gain practical experience.

5. Read code written by others: improve your skills by reading and analyzing code written by experienced programmers.

Cheers!
