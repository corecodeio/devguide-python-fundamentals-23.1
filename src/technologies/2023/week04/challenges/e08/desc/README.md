# Run Python

## Python online

Developers preferably use Python installed in a local environment. However, there are other environments where code can be executed online. Some of them are:

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [Replit](https://replit.com/languages/python3)
- [Online Python](https://www.online-python.com/)

In this case, we'll use Google Colab but you can select another tool.

## Our first Hello World

Let's make our first program in Python!

We'll explain more about the Python syntax on the next sections. In this initial program, we're gonna create a new file with the `.py` extension. The next instruction will output a text on terminal:

```python
print('Hello World')
```

where print() is a built-in function provided by Python, and the message is any string.


![hello world](../../../assets/python_hello_world.gif 'Hello World')

To execute the program, type `python` and the file name in your shell (if you are offline).

![hello world run](../../../assets/python_hello_world_run.gif 'Hello World Run')

If you're using an online tool, you should see an output like this:

![colab](../../../assets/google_colab.gif 'Google Colab')

## It's just the beginning

The next step is to keep going with the Python module, and here are some recommendations if you wanna learn and practice more about Python:

1. Start with the basics: get a good grasp of the basic concepts of Python. 

2. Use online resources: There are plenty of online resources available to learn Python, including video tutorials, blogs, etc.

3. Practice coding: The best way to learn Python is to write code.

4. Build projects: this will help you to apply your knowledge and gain practical experience.

5. Read code written by others: improve your skills by reading and analyzing code written by experienced programmers.

Cheers!
