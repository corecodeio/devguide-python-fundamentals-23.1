# Code complexity

## Description

See these two code fragment for get the same result and specify the code complexity of the code and select the best option.

**Computing the Sum of the First n Natural Numbers**

Option 1:
```python
# Using a loop to compute the sum
n = 10
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    sum += i
print(sum)
```

Option 2:
```python
# Using the closed-form formula to compute the sum
n = 10
sum = n*(n+1)/2
print(sum)
```
