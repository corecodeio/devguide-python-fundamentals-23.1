# Printing Multiplication Tables

## Solution ðŸ˜Ž

```python
num = 5

i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(f"{num} x {i} = {num*i}")
    i += 1
```

In this program, we use a while loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 10. We use an f-string to print the multiplication table for the input number and the current loop variable. Finally, we increment the loop variable by 1.
