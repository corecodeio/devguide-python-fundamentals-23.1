# Counting Even and Odd Numbers

## Solution ðŸ˜Ž

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

even_count = 0
odd_count = 0

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        even_count += 1
    else:
        odd_count += 1

print("elements:", numbers)
print(f"There are {even_count} even numbers and {odd_count} odd numbers in the list.")
```

In this program, we use a for loop to iterate through each number in the list. We use an if/else statement to check if the number is even or odd, and increment the corresponding counter variable. Finally, we print the results using an f-string.
