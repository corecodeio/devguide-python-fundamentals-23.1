# Average

## Solution ðŸ˜Ž

```python
numbers = [4, 5, 34, 9, 12, 0, 873]

total_sum = sum(numbers)
count = len(numbers)
average = total_sum / count

print('numbers:', numbers)
print('average:', average)
```

We then calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list using the built-in `sum` function and store it in the variable `total_sum`.

Next, we calculate the count of numbers in the list using the built-in `len` function and store it in the variable `count`.

Finally, we calculate the average by dividing the `total_sum` by the count, we store it in the variable `average` and we print it.
