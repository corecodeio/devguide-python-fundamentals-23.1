# Coming of age

## Solution ðŸ˜Ž

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("Youâ€™re of legal age.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

In this code, the `input()` function prompts the user to enter their age, and the int() function converts the input to an integer. Then, an `if-else` conditional structure is used to check if the entered age is greater than or equal to 18, in which case the program prints "You are of legal age." If the age is less than 18, the program prints "You are a minor".
