# Space replacing

## Solution ðŸ˜Ž

```python
text = input()

result = text.replace(" ", "*")
print(result)
```

In this code, the the `input()` function prompts the user to enter their text that contains spaces. We then use the `replace()` method to replace all spaces in the string with asterisks. The `replace()` method takes two arguments: the first argument is the substring to be replaced (in this case, a space), and the second argument is the string to replace it with (in this case, an asterisk).

The modified string is stored in a new variable called result, and we print it to verify that the replacement was successful.
