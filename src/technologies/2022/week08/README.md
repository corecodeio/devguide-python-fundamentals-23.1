<p>Here you will learn about Sorting and Searching Algorithms</p>

## Week subtopics

  - Sorting Algorithms
    - Bubble Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Insertion Sort
  - Searching Algorithms
    - Linear Search
    - Binary Search
    - Interpolation Search


## Week challenges (Monday) 💻
1. [Sorting a List of Strings by Length Using Bubble Sort](./challenges/e00/desc)
2. [Sorting a List of Zip Codes Using Selection Sort](./challenges/e01/desc)

## Week challenges (Tuesday) 💻
1. [Implementing Merge Sort to Sort a List of Integers](./challenges/e02/desc) 
Implement the merge sort algorithm to sort a list of integers. Provide them with a partially implemented function that sorts the list using merge sort but has some missing parts that they need to fill in.

2. [Finding the Kth Smallest Element in a List using Quickselect Algorithm](./challenges/e03/desc)
Implement the Quickselect algorithm to find the Kth smallest element in a list. Provide them with a partially implemented function that uses Quickselect but has some missing parts that they need to fill in.

## Week challenges (Wednesday) 💻
1. [Implementing Binary Search Tree in Python](./challenges/e04/desc)
Implement a Binary Search Tree in Python. Provide them with a partially implemented class that represents a binary search tree but has some missing parts that they need to fill in.

2. [Searching a List of Integers using Interpolation Search](./challenges/e05/desc)
Implement the interpolation search algorithm to search a list of integers. Provide them with a partially implemented function that searches the list using interpolation search but has some missing parts that they need to fill in.

## Week challenges (Thursday) 💻
1. [Sorting a List of Tuples based on Multiple Keys](./challenges/e06/desc)
Challenge the students to sort a list of tuples based on multiple keys using Python's built-in sorted() function. Provide them with a list of tuples with some missing code that they need to fill in to sort the list based on multiple keys.

2. [Implementing Radix Sort to Sort a List of Integers](./challenges/e07/desc)
Implement the radix sort algorithm to sort a list of integers. Provide them with a partially implemented function that sorts the list using radix sort but has some missing parts that they need to fill in.
