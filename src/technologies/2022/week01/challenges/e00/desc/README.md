## Description

In order to start solving the exercises within the bootcamp, it is necessary to have prepared a repository where all the solved exercises will be kept in control

## Create your README

1. Log in into your github account, [here](https://github.com/login)
2. Click on `new`, or click [here](https://github.com/new) to start the new repository setup<br>
   ![New repository](../../.../../../assets/readme-0.png 'new repository')
3. Once inside the repository setup
   - Fill the **repository name**: `core-code-from-scratch-readme` (you can use this name or any other name that you like)
   - Select **Public** repository option
   - Select **Add a README file** option
   - Click `Create repository` to finish the setup

   ![Repository](../../../assets/readme-2.png 'repository')

5. Send us the url of your repository (via slack to `Madeleine`), example url: `https://github.com/yosefmarr/core-code-from-scratch-readme`

## Edit your README

To edit your README repository you can do it localy from your computer or online from the Github page, we are going to check how we can do it online. For the local option you need to follow the required [Github Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) along this bootcamp, the completition of this course would be of help in this bootcamp, and this will be an assigment for the first weeks of the bootcamp. The sooner you start, the better

1. Click on the `pencil icon` (edit option)
   ![Edit readme](../../../assets/readme-3.png 'edit readme')
2. The file would be available to be edited
   ![Editable readme](../../../assets/readme-4.png 'editable readme')
3. Inside the `Edit file` tab, you can add `Markdown` syntax to start editing your file, you can find more about the `Markdown` syntax on the [Help links](#help-links) section
   ![Edit tab](../../../assets/readme-5.png 'edit tab')
4. Inside the `Preview` tab, you can se how your README file would look like
   ![Preview tab](../../../assets/readme-6.png 'preview tab')
5. To save your changes, at the bottom of the edit section, you would find a button called `Commit changes`. Add a description to your changes and click the button to save the changes
   ![Save changes](../../../assets/readme-7.png 'save changes')

## More about your README

Within the repository it is possible to create folders and more README files, this example refers to a single file. But we leave to you the design of your README, it can be only one file or several files, you can also take into account that this guide uses the same technique, so you can also copy the structure of this guide to be able to create your README
