## Solution ðŸ˜Ž

1. Ask which volume is required (cube, pyramid or sphere)
2. If we need a cube then: <br>
   2.1 Ask the length of one side <br>
   2.2 Since it is supposed to be the same in the three sides, the volume is: volume = side _ side _ side or volume = side^3 <br>
   2.3 Print the value calculated, in this case would be: 'volume' <br>
3. If we need a sphere then: <br>
   3.1 Ask the length of the radius <br>
   3.2 The value of the volume is: 4/3 _ pi _ r^3 <br>
   3.3 Print the value of the volume
4. If we need a pyramid then: <br>
   4.1 Ask the length of the base and call it 'base*length' <br>
   4.2 Ask the width of the base and call it 'base_width' <br>
   4.3 Ask the height of the pyramid and call it 'height' <br>
   4.4 The value of the volume is defined as: 1/3 * base*length * base_width \* height <br>
   4.5 Print the value of the volume <br>
5. End
