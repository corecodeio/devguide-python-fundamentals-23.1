# Counting the Number of Characters in a String Using a For Loop

## Solution ðŸ˜Ž

```javascript
string = input("Enter a string: ")

count = 0
for char in string:
    count += 1

print("The string has", count, "characters.")
```

In this program, we first prompt the user to enter a string using the `input()` function. We then set the initial value of `count` to be 0, and use a for loop to iterate through each character in the string. For each character, we increment `count` by 1. Finally, we print out the value of `count`.
