# Code complexity

## Solution ðŸ˜Ž

Option 1:
```python
# Using a loop to compute the sum
n = 10
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    sum += i
print(sum)
```
This code fragment uses a loop to compute the sum of the first n natural numbers, where n is set to 10 in this example. The time complexity of this code is `O(n)`, where n is the value of `n`. This is because the code must iterate through the `for` loop n times, adding each number to the running total.

Option 2:
```python
# Using the closed-form formula to compute the sum
n = 10
sum = n*(n+1)/2
print(sum)

```
This code fragment uses the closed-form formula for computing the sum of the first n natural numbers. The time complexity of this code is `O(1)`, which means that it takes a constant amount of time to execute, regardless of the size of the input. This is because the formula does not involve any loops or iterations, and only a few basic arithmetic operations are required to compute the sum.

**Conclusion**
In general, if you only need to compute the sum of the first n natural numbers, the closed-form formula is more efficient than using a loop. However, if you need to perform more complex calculations or computations that cannot be expressed using a simple formula, then using a loop or other iterative approach may be necessary.
