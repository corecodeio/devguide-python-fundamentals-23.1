# Weather average

## Description

write an algorithm that loops indefinitely until 'x' is entered
which will calculate an average of the weather, note that for each value entered it should ask if it is fahrenheit or celsius, then ask for the value. add everything up and divide by the number of values â€‹â€‹entered. The result must be returned in celsius, have a function that, in case fahrenheit is entered, transforms it to celsius in order to add them.

## Expected output

```python
