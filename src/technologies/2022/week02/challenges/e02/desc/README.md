# Install PSeInt

## Description

For this week we are going to use a program called PSeInt, this tool will help us to understand key programming concepts using a pseudocode language. The description of this tool is the following:

```
It is a tool to assist a student in their first steps in programming.
Through a simple and intuitive pseudo-language in Spanish (complemented by a flowchart editor),
it allows you to focus your attention on the fundamental concepts of computational algorithms,
minimizing the difficulties of a language and providing a work environment with numerous aids and teaching resources.
```

In this guide, we will learn how to install it on our computers

## Installation link

You can find the installation file by clicking on this [link](https://pseint.sourceforge.net/), then you will need to select the installation file base on the operative system of your computer. Each of the options have their own instructions

## PSeInt for macOS

By selecting the macOS option, you will be redirected to the macOS installation page, in this page you will have one option for download. The package for macOS is a compressed file, in any of its versions. Once extracted (simply by double-clicking on the cache from "finder"), you will get the application. To install it between system applications (again from "finder") you will need to drag the PSeInt icon to "Applications" in the list of locations in the left panel. If you have any questions you can read the installation guide below the links (the square in red), and if you need more help you can also follow [this installation video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_wjboaeU-4)

At the end you will have PSeInt installed on your computer, and you are ready to use it üçæüéàü•≥

## PSeInt for GNU/Linux

By selecting the GNU/Linux option, you will be redirected to the GNU/Linux installation page, in this page you will have one option for download. The package for GNU/Linux is a tgz tablet. If you do not know which version to choose (32 or 64 bits) run the command `uname -m` in a terminal, and if the result is `x86_64` select the 64-bit, otherwise the 32bit. It does not need installation, just unzip and run in the "pseint" directory the file "pseint". You can do this from a terminal with the commands:

```cmd
  $ tar -xzvf pseint-l64-20210609.tgz
  $ cd pseint
  $ ./pseint
```

On first run, if the system has all the necessary libraries, PSeInt will offer to create shortcut icons both in the system menu and on the desktop, so you don't have to run it again from a terminal. If your system does not have all the required libraries, running in the console will list the missing libraries, which must be installed separately from your distribution's package manager.
If you have any questions you can read the installation guide below the links (the square in red)

## PSeInt Configuration (Windows / macOS / Linux)

After installing PSeInt we will need to install a configuration file, This configuration file will contain all the rules that we will be using for the pseudocode, these rules will be the way in which we will be writing the instructions of the pseudocode and will be given in the sessions.

To install this configuration file, first, we need to download it, by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1sWXw1kUx0-ir-gD1ac_PrpREvXqSBmb-&export=download), save the file on your computer.
