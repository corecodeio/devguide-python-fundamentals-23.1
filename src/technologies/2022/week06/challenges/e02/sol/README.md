# Determinate if an number it's even or odd

## Solution ðŸ˜Ž

```python
# Declare two boolean variables
number = 73

print('Number:', number)

# Check the conditions and make decisions
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(number, "is even.")
else:
    print(number, "is odd.")
```

In this code, we first define a number with an integer value. We then use the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the number is divisible by 2. If the remainder of the division is 0, the number is even, so we print a message indicating that. Otherwise, the number is odd, so we print a message indicating that.
