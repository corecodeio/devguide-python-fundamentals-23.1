# Toss coin

## Description

From the data we receive first a name and a value, then another name and another value, using the built-in function aleatorio() we simulate the flip of a coin,
We must return the name of the winner in capital letters and the value I win, to avoid cheating, if a player puts a value of zero or negative, the opponent automatically wins, in case both cheat, "game canceled" is returned.
