# Greetings

## Description

For this challenge, you need to create a program that prints a greeting based on an hour entered. The program should do the following:

- Print `Buenos dias!` if the hour is from 0 to 12
- Print `Buenas tardes!` if the hour is from 13 to 18
- Print `Buenas noches!` if the hour is from 19 to 23
- Ask the user if he wants to perform another greeting. If the answer is `Si`, the program must start again.
- At the end of the program, print out the number of times the program has greeted.
