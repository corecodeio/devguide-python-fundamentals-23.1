# Ascending and Descending Numbers

## Description

For this challenge we are going to print numbers in ascending or descending order. The user must enter a number, then he must enter if he wants to print the numbers in ascending or descending order. If the user chooses ascending, the numbers will be printed from the number `0` to the number entered, otherwise the numbers will be printed descending from the number entered to the number `0`.To solve this challenge remember to use the **For(Para)** loop.
